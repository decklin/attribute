Attribute
=========

This exists entirely as a hack around the lack of a document selector in
Webkit:

I write all my user stylesheets in Sass, so I place everything under:

    html[hostname="example.org"]

If you do them by hand, prepending this to every selector will probably
get annoying. There's also no good way to match both example.org and
*.example.org (I usually give up and use hostname$=, but that also
matches badexample.org. What do you you want, it's a kludge).
